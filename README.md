## Project Overview
This is my professional portfolio site; it is a simple site that will easily allow any employer to get an idea of who I am, view all relevant contact info, and download my CV easily. I prioritised high readability via contrast, a clear layout, responsiveness and good performance metrics, boasting a very good Google Lighthouse score in all metrics.


## Key Technologies
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Mix of CSS grid & Flex layout
- CSS Variables

## Development Notes
The Mobile menu is not 100% my own code, I created the JavaScript logic and tailored it to work with the menu you see now. I followed along with a tutorial for the bare shell of the mobile menu and the little animated burger button. But anything else CSS-related is my own work.
All HTML is mine.

## Future Plans
As I create more projects, Full-Stack or not, I will add them to this site. I also aim to get professional working experience soon after college has finished. In the event I do, I will add a new section to highlight my work experience.
